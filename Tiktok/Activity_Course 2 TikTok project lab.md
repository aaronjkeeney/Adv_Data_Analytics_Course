# **TikTok Project**
**Course 2 - Get Started with Python**

Welcome to the TikTok Project!

You have just started as a data professional at TikTok.

The team is still in the early stages of the project. You have received notice that TikTok's leadership team has approved the project proposal. To gain clear insights to prepare for a claims classification model, TikTok's provided data must be examined to begin the process of exploratory data analysis (EDA).

A notebook was structured and prepared to help you in this project. Please complete the following questions.

# **Course 2 End-of-course project: Inspect and analyze data**

In this activity, you will examine data provided and prepare it for analysis.
<br/>

**The purpose** of this project is to investigate and understand the data provided. This activity will:

1.   Acquaint you with the data

2.   Compile summary information about the data

3.   Begin the process of EDA and reveal insights contained in the data

4.   Prepare you for more in-depth EDA, hypothesis testing, and statistical analysis

**The goal** is to construct a dataframe in Python, perform a cursory inspection of the provided dataset, and inform TikTok data team members of your findings.
<br/>
*This activity has three parts:*

**Part 1:** Understand the situation
* How can you best prepare to understand and organize the provided TikTok information?

**Part 2:** Understand the data

* Create a pandas dataframe for data learning and future exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical activities

* Compile summary information about the data to inform next steps

**Part 3:** Understand the variables

* Use insights from your examination of the summary data to guide deeper investigation into variables

<br/>

To complete the activity, follow the instructions and answer the questions below. Then, you will us your responses to these questions and the questions included in the Course 2 PACE Strategy Document to create an executive summary.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on to Course 3. You can assess your work by comparing the results to a completed exemplar after completing the end-of-course project.

# **Identify data types and compile summary information**


Throughout these project notebooks, you'll see references to the problem-solving framework PACE. The following notebook components are labeled with the respective PACE stage: Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Execute.

# **PACE stages**

   *        [Plan](#scrollTo=psz51YkZVwtN&line=3&uniqifier=1)
   *        [Analyze](#scrollTo=mA7Mz_SnI8km&line=4&uniqifier=1)
   *        [Construct](#scrollTo=Lca9c8XON8lc&line=2&uniqifier=1)
   *        [Execute](#scrollTo=401PgchTPr4E&line=2&uniqifier=1)

## **PACE: Plan**

Consider the questions in your PACE Strategy Document and those below to craft your response:



### **Task 1. Understand the situation**

*   How can you best prepare to understand and organize the provided information?


*Begin by exploring your dataset and consider reviewing the Data Dictionary.*

## **PACE: Analyze**

Consider the questions in your PACE Strategy Document to reflect on the Analyze stage.

### **Task 2a. Imports and data loading**

Start by importing the packages that you will need to load and explore the dataset. Make sure to use the following import statements:
*   `import pandas as pd`

*   `import numpy as np`



```python
# Import packages
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

Then, load the dataset into a dataframe. Creating a dataframe will help you conduct data manipulation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical activities.

**Note:** As shown in this cell, the dataset has been automatically loaded in for you. You do not need to download the .csv file, or provide more code, in order to access the dataset and proceed with this lab. Please continue with this activity by completing the following instructions.


```python
# Load dataset into dataframe
data = pd.read_csv("tiktok_dataset.csv")
```

### **Task 2b. Understand the data - Inspect the data**

View and inspect summary information about the dataframe by **coding the following:**

1. `data.head(10)`
2. `data.info()`
3. `data.describe()`

*Consider the following questions:*

**Question 1:** When reviewing the first few rows of the dataframe, what do you observe about the data? What does each row represent?

**Question 2:** When reviewing the `data.info()` output, what do you notice about the different variables? Are there any null values? Are all of the variables numeric? Does anything else stand out?

**Question 3:** When reviewing the `data.describe()` output, what do you notice about the distributions of each variable? Are there any questionable values? Does it seem that there are outlier values?


















```python
# Display and examine the first ten rows of the dataframe
data.head(10)
```

===> ENTER YOUR RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS 1-3 HERE

1. Each row contains data on a single TikTok video. video ID, duration, interaction counts of various types, the text transcription, and information about the creator/author.

2. From the summary info, we can see that there are a few null values, but they are somewhat consistent. There are 19,382 total entries in the table. Some columns have this many entries, but others have only 19,084. This likely means that there was a specific error in compiling the data, or there are some kinds of content that do not have certain types of information. Sorting by view count or status will likely help us get to the bottom of this.

3. It is worth noting that many of the stdev values are higher than the means. This makes sense for a platform that is based on sharing and viral properties of videos. The "highest performing" content will skew these distributions. Despite some of the values being large, I do not believe that they are necessarily excludable outliers. The describe() function also shows us that there are 298 videos that are missing all the numeric data, except that they exist.

### **Task 2c. Understand the data - Investigate the variables**

In this phase, you will begin to investigate the variables more closely to better understand them.

You know from the project proposal that the ultimate objective is to use machine learning to classify videos as either claims or opinions. A good first step towards understanding the data might therefore be examining the `claim_status` variable. Begin by determining how many videos there are for each different claim status.


```python
# What are the different values for claim status and how many of each are in the data?
print(data['claim_status'].value_counts().sum())
data['claim_status'].value_counts()

```

    19084





    claim      9608
    opinion    9476
    Name: claim_status, dtype: int64



**Question:** What do you notice about the values shown?
There are both claims and opinions, and the two types total 19,084, which is the number we expected. We understand the source of the discrepancy. Not all the videos in the data set are marked as having a claim or opinion.

Next, examine the engagement trends associated with each different claim status.

Start by using Boolean masking to filter the data according to claim status, then calculate the mean and median view counts for each claim status.


```python
# What is the average view count of videos with "claim" status?
claim_mask = data['claim_status'] == 'claim'
print('Mean views for "claim" status:', data[claim_mask].mean()['video_view_count'])
print('Median views for "claim" status:', data[claim_mask].median()['video_view_count'])
```

    Mean views for "claim" status: 501029.4527477102
    Median views for "claim" status: 501555.0



```python
# What is the average view count of videos with "opinion" status?
opinion_mask = data['claim_status'] == 'opinion'
print('Mean views for "opinion" status:', data[opinion_mask].mean()['video_view_count'])
print('Median views for "opinion" status:', data[opinion_mask].median()['video_view_count'])

```

    Mean views for "opinion" status: 4956.43224989447
    Median views for "opinion" status: 4953.0


**Question:** What do you notice about the mean and media within each claim category?
In both of these statuses, the mean and median are very close together, which is reassuring from the standpoint about making assumptions of normal(ish) distribution. It is worth noting that the mean and median views for the claim status are two orders of magnitude larger than for opinions.

Now, examine trends associated with the ban status of the author.

Use `groupby()` to calculate how many videos there are for each combination of categories of claim status and author ban status.


```python
# Get counts for each group combination of claim status and author ban status
data.groupby(['claim_status', 'author_ban_status']).count()[['#']]
# I decided to limit this objec to just number for readability.

```

**Question:** What do you notice about the number of claims videos with banned authors? Why might this relationship occur?
The number of claim videos with banned authors is the smallest of the claim categories. This makes sense, since an author can be banned for making false claims.

Continue investigating engagement levels, now focusing on `author_ban_status`.

Calculate the median video share count of each author ban status.


```python
data.groupby(['claim_status', 'author_ban_status'])['video_share_count'].median()
```




    claim_status  author_ban_status

**Question:** What do you notice about the share count of banned authors, compared to that of active authors? Explore this in more depth.
Banned authors appear to have a larger median video share count, which would indicate a propensity for the spread of disinformation.

Use `groupby()` to group the data by `author_ban_status`, then use `agg()` to get the count, mean, and median of each of the following columns:
* `video_view_count`
* `video_like_count`
* `video_share_count`

Remember, the argument for the `agg()` function is a dictionary whose keys are columns. The values for each column are a list of the calculations you want to perform.


```python
data.groupby('author_ban_status')['video_view_count','video_like_count','video_share_count'].agg(['count','mean','median'])
```

**Question:** What do you notice about the number of views, likes, and shares for banned authors compared to active authors?
There is way more interaction(views, likes, and shares) for each video from a banned author by a LARGE margin.

Now, create three new columns to help better understand engagement rates:
* `likes_per_view`: represents the number of likes divided by the number of views for each video
* `comments_per_view`: represents the number of comments divided by the number of views for each video
* `shares_per_view`: represents the number of shares divided by the number of views for each video


```python
# Create a likes_per_view column
data['likes_per_view'] = data['video_like_count'] / data['video_view_count']

# Create a comments_per_view column
data['comments_per_view'] = data['video_comment_count'] / data['video_view_count']

# Create a shares_per_view column
data['shares_per_view'] = data['video_share_count'] / data['video_view_count']

```

Use `groupby()` to compile the information in each of the three newly created columns for each combination of categories of claim status and author ban status, then use `agg()` to calculate the count, the mean, and the median of each group.


```python
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
data.groupby(['author_ban_status','claim_status'])['likes_per_view', 'comments_per_view', 'shares_per_view'].agg(['count','mean','median'])
```

**Question:**

How does the data for claim videos and opinion videos compare or differ? Consider views, comments, likes, and shares.

It appears that banned authors enjoy more likes, comments, and shares per view, possibly by approximately 30%.

### **Given your efforts, what can you summarize for Rosie Mae Bradshaw and the TikTok data team?**

*Note for Learners: Your answer should address TikTok's request for a summary that covers the following points:*

*   What percentage of the data is comprised of claims and what percentage is comprised of opinions?
*   What factors correlate with a video's claim status?
*   What factors correlate with a video's engagement level?


==> ENTER YOUR RESPONSE HERE

1. We can see that claims and opinions have approximately equal prevalence. While claims are slightly more common, the difference is not statistically significant( P=0.17).

2. There are many more 'claim' videos in banned and under review authors. This dos not inherently give us mroe information, since people are not banned for opinions, just false claims.

3. We see much higher engagement with claim videos, espeically from banned authors. This demonstrates the need for a strong system to combat misinformation.

4. below are posted the sample takeaways, so that I can reference them later:

Exemplar response: We know that videos by banned authors and those under review tend to get far more views, likes, and shares than videos by non-banned authors. However, when a video does get viewed, its engagement rate is less related to author ban status and more related to its claim status.

Also, we know that claim videos have a higher view rate than opinion videos, but this tells us that claim videos also have a higher rate of likes on average, so they are more favorably received as well. Furthermore, they receive more engagement via comments and shares than opinion videos.

Note that for claim videos, banned authors have slightly higher likes/view and shares/view rates than active authors or those under review. However, for opinion videos, active authors and those under review both get higher engagement rates than banned authors in all categories.

Exemplar response:

Of the 19,382 samples in this dataset, just over 50% are claims—9,608 of them.
Engagement level is strongly correlated with claim status. This should be a focus of further inquiry.
Videos with banned authors have significantly higher engagement than videos with active authors. Videos with authors under review fall between these two categories in terms of engagement levels.
